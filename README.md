This project utilised arduino unos as well as circuits parts such as potentiometers and decoders as well as seven segment displays.
The value of the poteniometer was supposd to be viewed on the sseg from a value of 0 to 99.
I have managed to connect the arduino to the potentiometer so that it may properly output a signal value of 0-99.
I have not managed to succesfully wire the decoders to the seven segment displays, this bit i had a bit of issue with.
